1. visited can not be written out of for w1, w2 in zip(sentence1, sentence2). This is because
in one sentence, it may appear the same word two times.
Then if you skip this word when you come across this word 2nd times, this will lead to False answer.
But actually it is the similar sentence.

For example: sentence1: The great honor for great people.
             sentence2: The perfect honor for nice people.

Here great appear 2 times, but the answer will be True. if you write visited out of for loop, this will lead wrong answer.
