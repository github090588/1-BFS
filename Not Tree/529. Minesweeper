1. def num_bombs(board, x, y):
        count = 0
        for dx, dy in dirr:
            if 0 <= x + dx < row and  0 <= y + dy < col and board[x+dx][y+dy] == "M":
                count += 1
        return count

This function helps us judge if the neighbor of this point has bomb. If it does not, then we find the neighbor.

2. after poping up the first element, we only consider the case board[x][y] == "E". This is because in EX1, in the top between 1E1 is still E. We keep
this E remained.
