1. there is no need to compare, since BFS will finish level by level


1   X    3    4
5   6    7    X
9   X    11   X
13  X    15   16


queue =     3   13  |   4  7  9   |   1   11   5  |   15   1   |    16 


2. This problem can not write BFS right after when we find the initial point.
We should let two gates find the neighbor at the same time.

3. The difference between writing right after the initial and writing seperately is that,
if you need to count the number by a bulk, you always do BFS after find the initial points.

4. see "|" if you count something until this "|". In example 01 matrix that we need to put all 0 into the queue so that the first "|"
stops at 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |, then we count. But if you do BFS right after first 0, then it will appear 0 |. The count will be chaotic.

5. # ending
                    if rooms[xx][yy] == 2147483647:
                        rooms[xx][yy] = count
                    
                        # put the neighbor into the queue
                        queue.append((xx, yy))
