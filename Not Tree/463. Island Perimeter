1. Note

if xx < 0 or xx == row or yy < 0 or yy == col:
      perimeter += 1
      continue
                                                                                                
if grid[xx][yy] == 0:
      perimeter += 1
      continue

in this two cases, we not only continue, but also update the result at the same time.
