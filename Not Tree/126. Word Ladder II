1. This time, queue is a dictionary, and key = neighbor, value is the list that we get until this neighbor. That is,

    newlayer[neighbor] += [j + [neighbor] for j in layer[word]]

2. Finding the 1st element, we use for word in layer, not like the standard popleft().

3. backtracking: 
wordSet -= set(newlayer.keys())
layer = newlayer
