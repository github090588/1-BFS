1. write count in different places.

(1) immediately after while queue. This case is equal to the case that writes after for loop find the neighbor

(2) write in the for loop that finds the neighbor. If you want to count every 1, then this is also ok.


2. Overall

(1) count many "1"s as a whole entirety, after while queue, we count += 1.

(2) count the number of levels like rotting orange. We use for _ in range(len(queue)) to count += 1 to finish a level.

(3) count the number of every element in the queue, then the method in 1 are all ok. we prefer to write count += 1 after poping the first element.
