1. # graph = {"a": [("b", 2.0)], "b": [("a", 1 / 2.0), ("c", 3.0)], "c": [("b", 1 / 3.0)]}

2. Note the condition of appearing -1.0 has 3 2 cases:

(1) if the nume or deno do not appear ever.  [["a","b"],["c","d"]], then let us compute "a" / "e" for example.

(2) if the neighbor does not equal to the denominator ever.  [["a","b"],["c","d"]], then let us compute "a" / "c" for example.
